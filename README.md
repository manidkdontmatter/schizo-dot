Grok 4 heavily assisted me in coding this. Although I do completely understand the code it created and bettered/optimized it slightly afterward. Grok doesn't create a very good project structure so overall it's a lot of spaghetti code, but it works. It's not a complicated project anyway because an AI model is doing most of the sentiment analysis. Actually strictly speaking this is not sentiment analysis, it's more elaborate and advanced, it uses transformers.js with bart-large-mnli zero shot classification (a type of "AI" to keep it simple), meaning it understands human language, context, emotion, etc, it can classify posts into any vague set of categories I provide for it. The categories aren't just words they can be phrases too, of any length, it will decide how well the post's vibe correlates to each category, giving it a score.

The AI is slow as f*ck though. Takes 5-10 minutes to process every post. Price to pay for complexity I guess
